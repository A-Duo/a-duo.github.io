title:  "What is House Bill 261?"
---

House Bill 261 is an anti DEI law which requires that no public institution have an office with "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion" in the name.

Beyond that it jeapordizes various scholarships by requiring that no scholarship "considers an individual's personal identity characteristics in determining receipt of state financial aid or other state financial assistance, including a scholarship award or tuition waiver."

They also define personal identity characteristics as "an individual's race, color, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, or gender identity."

This law isn't specifically an anti-trans bill but it does prevent public funds from being allocated to a scholarship for trans students.
