This bill ensures that students in public schools cannot have their educational recommended to align with their gender identity without parental consent.

Critics argue that this may reveal transgender students status as being transgender who attempt to use documentaiton of their education when getting a job.

Line 44:
"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a school or LEA may not...without written parental consent make changes to a student's education record regarding a student's gender identity that does not conform with the student's sex."

This bill was signed into law and went into effect on the 16th of February 2023.
