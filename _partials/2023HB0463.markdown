House Bill 463 is a follow up to 2022's House Bill 11. 

This bill prohibits public schools from being a part of athletic associations that do not verify a student's birth certificate.

It was written to ensure that student athletes are not allowed into competitions that don't match their sex assigned at birth.

This bill passed the house (56-14) but the legislative session ended before it could be seen in the senate.
