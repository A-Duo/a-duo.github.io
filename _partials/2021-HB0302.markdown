title:  "What is House Bill 302?"
---

House bill 302 was a bill that completely banned trans girls for participating on girls' teams even during practice and outside of competitions.

This bill is the original source for House Bill 11's controversial ammendment banning transgirls in girls' sports competitions.

H.B. 302's Text (line 61):
"A student of the male sex may not ***participate***, and a public school or LEA may not allow a student of the male sex to ***participate, in a school athletic activity designated as "female" or "girls'"***"

H.B. 11's Text (line 201): 
"A student of the male sex may not ***compete***, and a public school or LEA may not allow a student of the male sex to ***compete, with a team designated for students of the female sex in an interscholastic athletic activity***"

This bill passed the house (50-23) but the legislative session ended before it could be seen in the senate.
