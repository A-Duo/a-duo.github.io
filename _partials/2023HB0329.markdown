House bill 329 was a bill that required that sufficient notice be provided to parents so they can avoid any "Event with an adult theme."

An "event with an adult theme" is any event that:
- Contains content that may not be appropriate for children.
- Takes place in a public building or on public grounds.

-- Write the rest at home.
