---

House bill 303 that expands restrictions against teaching religion in public schools to include political positions and opinions on gender identity.

Teachers would also no longer be allowed to have passive endorsement or "invite, suggest, or encourage a student to reconsider or change the student's" position on religion, politics, or gender identity.

This law would make pride flags, crosses, and political iconography against the law to display in public schools.
